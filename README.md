## Algorithms and Data Structures practices - Codewars and Repl algorithms 

#### Some of codewars algorithms, and some of repl algorithms and data-structure practices.

##### How to Use `codewars files` file: 
Run: `node codewars/<filename>`

##### How to Use `repl-algs` file:
1) Uncomment specific part of code (algorithm) you want to run. (If needed call the function. eg `someFunction(someinput)` )

###### `// ---------------- ****************************** ------------------------ ` is "boundary" between diffrent algorithms.
