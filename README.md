## Algorithms and Data Structures practices - Codewards and Repl stuff

Some of saved repl algorithms i did in the past. And some other random (there is no better place for them) stuff. Mostly Algs and data structures.

##### How to Use `repl-algs` file
Uncomment specific part of code (algorithm) you want to run. (If needed call the function. eg `someFunction(someinput)` )

###### `// ---------------- ****************************** ------------------------ ` is "boundary" between diffrent algorithms.
