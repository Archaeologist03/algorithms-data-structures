## Algorithms-data-structures-and-repl-stuff
Some of saved repl algorithms i did in the past. And some other random (no better place to put on) stuff. Mostly Algs and data structures tho.

##### How to Use `repl-algs` file
Uncomment specific part of code (algorithm) you want to run. (If needed call the function. eg `someFunction(someinput)` )
